## Reporting a Vulnerability

Mail me from [my website](https://fvdm.com/contact) or by
going to the repository on GitHub > Security > [Report a
vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).


Please be specific about what you found and how you found it.
If available, please also include errors, log entries and any
research you have already done yourself about the problem.

I will keep in contact with you about the progress, if needed.
Your submission will be handled confidentially and all private
details will be deleted when the issue has been resolved or
rejected.

I kindly ask you to communicate in a friendly way and keep the
findings only between us while I'm working on a fix. Should you
find my solution insufficient or is it taking unreasonably long,
please do communicate that with me too. I'm always open to
feedback.
