geoip2ws
========

Unofficial Node.js module for the Maxmind GeoIP2 Web Services.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fvdm/nodejs-geoip2ws.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fvdm/nodejs-geoip2ws)


Usage
-----

There are multiple ways to load and set up this module. All communication is done over HTTPS.

#### One line

```js
require ('geoip2ws') (userId, licenseKey) (ip, callback);
```

#### Multiple calls, same account

```js
var geo = require ('geoip2ws') (userId, licenseKey);
geo (ip1, callback);
geo (ip2, callback);
```

#### Mix products (or accounts)

```js
var insights = new require ('geoip2ws') (userId, licenseKey, 'insights');
var country = new require ('geoip2ws') (userId, licenseKey, 'country');

// precise lookup, higher cost
insights (ip, callback);

// vague lookup, lower cost
country (ip, callback);
```


Installation
------------

You need a Maxmind account ID and license key with enough credits for one of their GeoIP *web*
services. You can find both [*here*](https://www.maxmind.com/en/my_license_key).

Stable: `npm install geoip2ws`

Develop: `npm install fvdm/nodejs-geoip2ws#develop`


The functions
-------------

The _first function_ is the setup and takes these arguments:

parameter      | type    | required | description
-------------- | ------- | -------- | --------------------------------
userId         | string  | yes      | Your Maxmind account user ID
licenseKey     | string  | yes      | Your Maxmind account license key
service        | string  | no       | The service you'd like to use: `insights`, `country`, `city` (default)
requestTimeout | integer | no       | Socket read timeout in milliseconds to wait for reply from MaxMind

```js
var geo = require ('geoip2ws') (1234, 'abc', 'country', 2000);
```


The _second function_ does the IP-address lookup and takes these arguments:

parameter | type     | required | description
--------- | -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------
service   | string   | no       | The service, same as above
ip        | string   | yes      | The IPv4 or IPv6 address to lookup, or use the string 'me' for the current machine
callback  | function | yes      | Your callback `function` to receive the data

```js
geo ('city', '145.53.252.135', myCallback);
```


Callback
--------

The callback function receives result data and errors. Unless an error occurs the
data JSON will be parsed to an object. When everything is ok `err` is `null` else
`err` is an instance of `Error`. It also returns API errors this same way.

```js
function myCallback (err, data) {
  if (err) {
    console.log (err, err.stack);
  } else {
    console.log (data.city.names.en);
  }
}
```
